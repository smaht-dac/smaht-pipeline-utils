This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the template structure necessary for implementing *File Reference* objects.
These objects enable users to codify information to track and version the reference files used by the pipeline.

Required

All the following fields are required.

name
----
Name of the reference file, **MUST BE GLOBALLY UNIQUE (ACROSS THE PORTAL OBJECTS)**.

description

``<format>`` needs to match a file format that has been previously defined, see :ref:`File Format <file_format>`.

version
-------
Version of the reference file.

category
--------
Categories for the pipeline, see `schemas <https://github.com/smaht-dac/smaht-portal/tree/main/src/encoded/schemas>`__.

type
----

All the following fields are optional and provided as example. Can be expanded to anything accepted by the schema, see `schemas <https://github.com/smaht-dac/smaht-portal/tree/main/src/encoded/schemas>`__.

secondary_files
---------------
List of ``<format>`` for secondary files associated to the reference file.
Each ``<format>`` needs to match a file format that has been previously defined, see :ref:`File Format <file_format>`.

status
------
Status of the upload.
The possible values are ``uploading`` and ``uploaded``.
If no value is specified, the status will not be updated during patching and set to ``uploading`` if posting the object for the first time.

Most likely you don't want to set this field and just use the default logic automatically applied during deployment.
