Deploy Pipelines to AWS Environment
===================================

This document describes how to deploy pipelines to a target AWS environment.
Although it's possible to run the deployment from a local machine, we highly recommend using an AWS EC2 machine.

Setup an EC2 Machine
====================

This step may be skipped if you have an EC2 already set up.

We recommend using the following configuration:

  * AMI: Use a Linux distribution (64-bit, x86)
  * Instance Type: t3.large or higher
  * Storage: 50+GB in main volume

Install Docker
==============

The deployment code will try to trigger remote AWS CodeBuild jobs to build and push the Docker containers implemented for the pipelines directly in AWS.
However, if no builder has been setup, it is possible to run a local build using Docker by passing the flag ``--local-build`` to the deployment command.

Running a local build requires having a Docker application running on the machine.
To install Docker in a EC2 machine, refer to the following instructions based on an Amazon Linux AMI:

Update packages:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo yum update -y

Install the Docker Engine package:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo yum install docker

Start the docker service:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo service docker start

Ensure Docker is installed correctly and has the proper permissions
by running a test command:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run hello-world

More information on how to setup Docker can be found in the
`AWS Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html>`_.

We now need to install the ``smaht_pipeline_utils`` software to deploy the pipeline components.

Install smaht_pipeline_utils
============================

The software is Python-based.
To install the software and the required packages, we recommend
using a fresh virtual environment.
Please refer to `pyproject.toml <https://github.com/smaht-dac/smaht-pipeline-utils/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_ for the supported Python version.

We recommend using pyenv to manage virtual environments.
Instructions for installing and using
pyenv can be found `here <https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/>`_.

Once the virtual environment is set up and activated, we can proceed to :ref:`install <install>` smaht-pipeline-utils software.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install from source
  git clone https://github.com/smaht-dac/smaht-pipeline-utils.git
  cd smaht-pipeline-utils
  make configure
  make update
  make build
  cd ..

  # Install from pypi
  pip install smaht-pipeline-utils

To check that the software is correctly installed, try to run ``smaht_pipeline_utils``.
If installed from source, this command may fail with a bash "command not found" error, try ``poetry run smaht_pipeline_utils`` instead.

Set Up Credentials and Environment Variables
==============================================

.. _auth_vars:

AWS Auth Credentials
--------------------

To deploy pipelines components in a specific AWS account,
we need to setup the following environment variables to authenticate to the account.

.. code-block:: bash

  export AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=
  export TIBANNA_AWS_REGION=
  export GLOBAL_ENV_BUCKET=
  export S3_ENCRYPT_KEY=

  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

  # Optional, depending on the account
  export S3_ENCRYPT_KEY_ID=
  export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=

**Tips**:

* *GLOBAL_ENV_BUCKET* can be found in the AWS Secrets Manager.
* *S3_ENCRYPT_KEY* and *S3_ENCRYPT_KEY_ID* can be found in the AWS Secrets Manager.
* *AWS_SESSION_TOKEN* is used by some single sign-on platforms for managing
  credentials but may not be required otherwise.
* *TIBANNA_AWS_REGION* is the main region for the AWS account.

Portal Credentials
------------------

We also need to setup credentials to authenticate to the portal database to push some of the portal components.
These credentials need to be stored as a key-pair file as described
`here <https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/cgap-portal/blob/master/docs/public/help/access_keys.md>`_.

The default path used by the code to locate this file is ``~/.cgap-keys.json``.
However, it is possible to specify a different key-pair file through a command line argument, if desired.

Example of a key-pair entry:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "<namespace>": {
        "key": "XXXXXXXX",
        "secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "server": "<URL>"
    }
  }

``<namespace>`` is the namespace for the environment and can be found in the portal health page (e.g., smaht-wolf).

.. _account_vars:

Target Account Information
--------------------------

Finally we need to setup the information to identify the target environment to use for the deployment.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Set the namespace of the target environment
  #   e.g., smaht-wolf
  export ENV_NAME=

  # Set the bucket used to store the worklow description files
  #   e.g., smaht-wolf-application-tibanna-cwls
  export WFL_BUCKET=

  # Set the path to the keypair file with the portal credential
  export KEYDICTS_JSON=~/.cgap-keys.json

  # Set up consortia and submission centers
  #   consortia and submission_centers need to correspond to metadata present on the portal
  #   e.g., ['smaht'] and ['smaht_dac']
  export CONSORTIA=
  export SUBMISSION_CENTERS=

  # If running sentieon code,
  #   specify the address for the server that validate the software license
  export SENTIEON_LICENSE=0.0.0.0

**Tips:**

* *ENV_NAME* is the namespace for the environment and can be found in the portal health page under ``Namespace``.
* *WFL_BUCKET* can be found in the portal health page under ``Tibanna CWLs Bucket``.
  This bucket will be used to store the workflow description files.

Running the Deployment
======================

The following code will use the ``pipeline_deploy`` command to deploy all the components from the repositories specified
by the ``--repos`` argument.

.. code-block:: bash

  smaht_pipeline_utils pipeline_deploy \
    --ff-env ${ENV_NAME} \
    --keydicts-json ${KEYDICTS_JSON} \
    --wfl-bucket ${WFL_BUCKET} \
    --account ${AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER} \
    --region ${TIBANNA_AWS_REGION} \
    --consortia ${CONSORTIA} \
    --submission-centers ${SUBMISSION_CENTERS} \
    --sentieon-server ${SENTIEON_LICENSE} \
    --post-software \
    --post-file-format \
    --post-file-reference \
    --post-workflow \
    --post-metaworkflow \
    --post-wfl \
    --post-ecr \
    --repos REPO [REPO ...]

It is possible to add flags to run the command in various debug modes, to validate the objects and test the pipeline implementation without running a real deployment.
For more details on the command line arguments refer to the documentation for the :ref:`pipeline_deploy <pipeline_deploy>` command.

An important argument is ``--branch``, this argument specifies the branch to check out for the target GitHub repository to build ECR through AWS CodeBuild.
The default is set to the ``main`` branch. The ``--local-build`` flag will prevent the code from using AWS CodeBuild and force a local build with Docker instead.

*Note: we are working to enable more builders with a command line argument for which builder to use to deploy modules from different repositories through AWS CodeBuild.*

Deploying SMaHT Pipelines
========================

SMaHT pipelines are released as a complete package with a customized set up for automated deployment to the desired environment.
To deploy the pipelines run the following steps:

1. Clone the main pipeline repository.
The submodules will be empty and set to the current commits saved for the main branch.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/smaht-dac/main-pipelines.git

2. Check out the desired version.
This will set the submodules to the commits saved for that pipeline release.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout <version>

3. Download the content for each submodule.
The submodules will be set in detached state on their current commit.

.. code-block:: bash

  make pull

4. Build smaht_pipeline_utils (optional).
This will build from source the latest version linked for the current release.

.. code-block:: bash

  make configure
  make update
  make build

5. Set up the auth credentials as described above.

6. Set the target account information in the ``.env`` file (see :ref:`above <account_vars>`).

7. Test the deployment using the base module only.

.. code-block:: bash

  make deploy-base

8. Deploy all the other modules.

.. code-block:: bash

  make deploy-all

Uploading the Reference Files
=============================

After a successful deployment, all required metadata and components for the pipelines are available within the infrastructure.
However, we are still missing the reference files necessary to run the pipelines.
We need to copy these files to the correct locations in AWS S3 buckets.

This can be done using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) (see :ref:`above <auth_vars>` how to set the auth credentials):

.. code-block:: bash

  # Copy the reference file to the right S3 bucket
  aws s3 cp <file> s3://<file_upload_bucket>/<file_location>

More details on how to setup the AWS CLI are available `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html>`_, and documentation for the ``cp`` command can be found `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.html>`_.

**Tips:**

  - ``<file_upload_bucket>`` can be found in the portal health page under ``File Upload Bucket``.
  - ``<file_location>`` can be found in the metadata page created for the reference file under ``Upload Key``.
    It follows the structure ``<uuid>/<accession>.<extension>``.

*Note: if a reference file has secondary files, these all need to be uploaded as well to the correct S3 location.*

Troubleshooting
===============

Some possible errors are described below.

Auth Errors
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

  botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (400) when calling
  the HeadBucket operation: Bad Request

This may indicate your credentials are out of date. Make sure your AWS
credentials are up to date and source them if necessary.

No Space Left on Device Errors
------------------------------

When running a local build, the EC2 may run out of space.
You can try one of the following:

1. Clean up old docker images that are no longer needed with a
   command such as ``docker rm -v $(docker ps -aq -f 'status=exited')``.
   More details at `<https://vsupalov.com/cleaning-up-after-docker/>`_.
2. Increase the size of your primary EBS volume: details
   `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html>`_.
3. Mount another EBS volume to ``/var/lib/docker``. Instructions to
   format and mount a volume are described
   `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html>`_,
   but note that you would skip the `mkdir` step and mount the
   volume to ``/var/lib/docker``.
